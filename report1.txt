Multiple Inheritance:
   =============


Python looks for each attribute in the class's parents as they are listed left to right.
Python will start by looking at A, and, if A doesn't have the attribute, then it will look at B.


in this example:
 if A doesn't have the attribute, 
then it will look at B.



class A :
    def __init__(self):     
      print("Hello from A ! ")


class B :
    def __init__(self):     
      print("Hello from B ! ")



class C(A,B):
   def __init__(self): 
       super(C,self).__init__()
       print("Hello from C ! ")



if we run :
C()

the output :
Hello from A ! 
Hello from C !
